Hello,
My name is Ipseeka Malla. I have attended this 3 days training from Pokhara,Nepal.
This training has been very helpful for me as  this is first time I am learning how to use git and github.
I have learnt how to use git and it's command like push,pull,commit,remote,clone etc in this session.

I would also like to take next training available to improve my skill.Thank you for your time.

Feedback:It was a great experience.Hope to learn more in coming future.
